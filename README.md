# Ideas
A bucket list of project ideas

## Bluetooth enabled AM Radio Transmitter

Connect to any radio (e.g. car) and play any music from your phone through bluetooth.

## Network Booster

Increase network download/upload speed (download higher priority) in a rural area. There are 2 solutions:
1. Better antenna selection
2. Use software to network bonding

## Car's controller

Read telemetry from OBD reader, useful for diagnosis. Since OBD port exposes diagnosis CAN network, it allows some level of access to the car, e.g. windows, car's locks, lights, etc.

## Detect intruder from your driveway

Using Wifi sensing to achieve hidden solar-powered sensors with no blindspot. The sensors' outputs can then be aggregated to form a precise location of the intruder. With this precise location, you can deploy a couple of drones to monitor its movement.
